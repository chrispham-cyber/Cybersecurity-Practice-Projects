# 1. Keylogger Project

## Overview
This project is a **keystroke logger** that captures and records the keys pressed on the keyboard, logging them into a file named **keystrokes.log**. It processes each key press event to handle specific actions, such as backspace, special characters, and modifier keys (Ctrl, Shift, Alt), and writes the corresponding character to a log file.

This project is useful for purposes such as creating simple keystroke logging applications, debugging, or testing keyboard input behavior. 

## How to use:
To run the script, using `sudo python3 keylogger.py &`

To view the log, using `cat keystrokes.log`

## Warning
**Keystroke logging can be intrusive and potentially violate privacy**. So it should be used responsibly and ethically.
